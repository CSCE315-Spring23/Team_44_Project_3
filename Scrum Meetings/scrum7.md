## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We started our meeting with a discussion of everyone's progress with their tasks and any road blocks someone might have. Everyone talked about the various implementations they added to the project and if they had any problems or challenges. For those that were facing blockers, we discussed any potential solutions to the problems. Then we moved on to what we wanted done by the next SCRUM meeting. We divided those tasks and then ended the meeting as many of us had exams to prepare for.
