## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We talked about general ideas of the framework and how we wanted to structure the files in our project for both client side and server side. After discussing how to set up and run the project, we started talking about the different roles and specific tasks for everyone. We decided that Kevin and Steven will work on backend, Huy and Shreeman will work on front end, and Sloan will work as an intermediary who works and helps on both sides. After that, we assigned some tasks to do for everyone, and we made sure no one has any problems in their React setup.
