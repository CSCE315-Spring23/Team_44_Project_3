## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We started this meeting discussing the progress we have made so far in Sprint 3. We all agreed that our progress has been a little slow due to the lack of new functionality that needed to be implemented as well as exams. For the most part, the only thing left to do is make sure the project looks visually appealing. Each of talked about what we have done so far, any blockers, and what we should do and split it amongst ourselves. We figured out what was left we wanted to do and delegated those tasks. Then we finished the meeting with a discussion of the final presentation. We agreed on a dress code and what we should cover during the presentation. More details will have to be discussed when we receive more information about the specifics of the presentation.
