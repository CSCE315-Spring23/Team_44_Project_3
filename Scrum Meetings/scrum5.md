## Minutes from Previous Meeting
With more parts being developed, testing become an increasingly relevant task that needed to be complete. As most of the functionality itself is complete, we are focusing on post-production tasks, such as refactoring code to make way for the new features, stress testing our code, and polishing the rough edges.
