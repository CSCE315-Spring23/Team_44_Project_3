## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We first discussed the progress and challenges we faced from Sprint 1. We agreed that our main challenge from Sprint 1 is learning and setting up React correctly. Once we got used to React, our progress became smoother. We all liked the progress we made in Sprint 1, having a minimum viable product that users can interact and have majority of the functionality there. Next, we discussed future plans for Sprint 2 from the backlogs on what we want completed by the end of this sprint. We delegated a brief overview of the tasks to certain members of the team, and then talked about what we wanted completed by the next SCRUM meeting. We finished discussing a high-level overview of the rest of project, including sprint 3.
