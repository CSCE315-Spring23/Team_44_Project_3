## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We first discussed basic SCRUM meeting questions: “What did you do since the last meeting?”, “Are there any blockers?”, “What will you do before next meeting?”. Since the last meeting, we made some significant progress in creating the various pages that we need, as well as finishing up translating the Java Controllers from Project 2 to API calls. Our main blocker was the learning curve for React. Once we get it down and get used to it, we should have smoother progress. We finished our scrum meeting by talking about what to do next and assign tasks until the next scrum meeting.
