## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We started the meeting discussing our progress in the project which we collectively agreed that we are in a pretty good spot. We have made significant progress in our POS and will continue to do so. Next, we discussed any blockers we may have. For the most part, our struggles with React have diminished. It’s not completely gone, there are some things we needed to figure out, but it’s getting there. Our main problem right now is making an Order persist across different routes. We plan to solve this before the end of the sprint. We also talked about the backlogs and made sure it is up to date with the correct times and items completed.
