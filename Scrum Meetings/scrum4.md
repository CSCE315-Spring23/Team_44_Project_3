## Minutes from Previous Meeting
We opened this SCRUM meeting with a discussion about the progress we made since the previous meeting and any blockers we may have faced along the way. Overall, all of our progress has been very smooth with little to no blockers. The only problem is a lot of the team members were testing this past week, so progress slowed more than usual, but we plan to pick it up once the testing is over. Next, we discussed the next steps before the next SCRUM meeting. We talked about the tasks we wanted to get done and who should do what. We finished with any questions and clarifications on what was expected of each task.
